 Speed up reasoning model without finetuning.


 ## Quick Start

 ## What is Dynasor?

 Dynasor is a tool that helps you speed up LLM reasoning model without training or finetuning. It uses a combination of techniques to improve & dynamically execute the prompt, and stop when the LLM has enough information to make a decision.

 Dynasor-CoT is a subset of Dynasor library that optimizes for reasoning model such as `Deepseek-R1` and its distilled variants.
